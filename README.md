Hello world, 

I am finally getting into the GitHub universe and attempting to learn how to use this resource in my coding endeavors. 

I primarily work with R, through RStudio, writing code to develop visualizations of water quality and meteorological data. I manage a long-term monitoring program called the System-Wide Monitoring Program (SWMP) in St. Augustine, FL.
